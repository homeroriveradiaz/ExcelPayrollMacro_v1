# ExcelPayrollMacro_v1

About the code:
This is to demonstrate features of of VBA for MS Excel; The code is not efficient and  was never meant to be.
It could be re-used or it could help as a reference for another project.
The data used in the sample Excel files is available at https://www.thespreadsheetguru.com/sample-data/
You'll have to use the files in this repo for the code to work, because I did some tweaking to the file from thespreadsheetguru.com

Pre-requisites:
MS Excel, 2007 and later most recommended. Earlier could work but can't guarantee.

Instructions:
1. Create folder C:\temp\Excel examples\ and save all files in this repo to that folder.
You can use another folder by changing lines of code 59 and 68 (basically, changing any references to "C:\temp\Excel examples\").
2. Open the file "Employee Sample Data.xlsx", create a Macro, edit it, and paste MacrosCode.vb in its place.
3. Make sure no other Excel file is open
4. Execute macro "FormatPayrollData".
